 Code Implementation of the Solution to the Puzzle of the Hiding Cat

Little exercise I made just for fun, after watching <a href="https://youtu.be/yZyx9gHhRXM">this video</a>
<br>I tried to implement an ABAP solution valid for any given number of boxes; the default number is set to 5 but it can be changed in the selection screen of the program.
